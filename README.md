# rsmp-crawl
Three main parts: crawler (downloader), ORM model and xml processor.

ORM model is created by structure (.xsd) file.

You cannot use this as a module for now, tbh.

I have a roadmap, actually.

* transfrom into module structure
* add constraints from xsd check
* maaan, we need a refactor
